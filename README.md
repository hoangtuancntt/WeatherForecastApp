# WeatherForecastApp
I implemented this app by using MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Data Binding...

MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.

Technologies used:
1. Retrofit a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
2. Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.
3. ViewModel to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
4. LiveData to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
5. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
6. Data Binding to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository
2. This project requires a minimum API level of 21.
